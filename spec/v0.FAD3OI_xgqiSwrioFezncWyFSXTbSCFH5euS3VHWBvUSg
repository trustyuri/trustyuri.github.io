Trusty URI Specification - Version 0
====================================

_Tobias Kuhn, 20 May 2014, http://www.trustyuri.net_

This document contains version 0 of the specification of the _trusty URI_
approach (previously called _hash-URIs_).


Basics
------

Hash values of trusty URIs are encoded in Base64 notation with some common
modifications for making it safe to use them in URIs and filenames:

> **Definition 1.**
> Every character that is a standard ASCII letter (`A-Z` or `a-z`), a digit
> (`0-9`), a hyphen (`-`), or an underscore (`_`) is called a _Base64
> character_, representing in this order the numbers from 0 to 63. There are no
> other Base64 characters.

Trusty URIs have the following structure:

> **Definition 2.**
> Every trusty URI ends with at least 25 Base64 characters. The sequence of
> characters following the last non-Base64 character is called the _artifact
> code_. The first two characters of the artifact code are called the _module
> identifier_. The sequence of characters following the module identifier
> is called _data part_, which is identical to or contains a _hash part_.

The current modules only generate URIs with exactly 45 trailing Base64
characters, but we keep the definition open for future modules.

The first character of the module identifier specifies the type of content
and therefore the type of module; the second character is a version number
of the module. The main content of the data part is the hash value, but
it can also contain other information such as parameters and sub-types. Its
concrete structure depends on the module.

As everybody who has access to the respective domain is free to define and use
URIs at will, we can only be sure that a certain URI is a trusty URI once we
have found and verified a content that matches the hash. For that reason, we
need to introduce the concept of a _potential trusty URI_:

> **Definition 3.**
> Every URI that could be a trusty URI according to the restrictions of
> Definition 2, that has a module identifier matching a defined module, and
> whose data part is consistent with the structural restrictions of the given
> module (in particular with respect to its length) is called a _potential
> trusty URI_.

With these ingredients, trusty URIs can be verified:

> **Definition 4.**
> Given a potential trusty URI and a digital artifact, if the identifier part
> refers to an module that returns a hash value for the digital artifact
> that is identical to the one encoded in the hash part, then the potential
> trusty URI is a _verified trusty URI_ and the digital artifact is its
> _verified content_.

For convenience reasons, we can append a file extension like `.txt` or `.nq`
to trusty URIs. The resulting URIs are technically no trusty URIs anymore, but
it is easy to strip the extension and get the respective trusty URIs.
As the hash is located in the final part of the URI, it is straightforward to
store it in file names and to deal with it in a local file system without
worrying about the first part of the URI. For example:

    r1.RAcbjcRIQozo2wBMq4WcCYkFAjRz0AX-Ux3PquZZrC68s.nq

These files are called _trusty files_.


Modules
-------

There are currently two modules available: `RA` and `FA`.


### Module FA

Version A of module type F, i.e. module `FA`, works on the byte content of
files.

A hash value is calculated using SHA-256 on the content of the file in byte
representation. The file name and other metadata are not considered. Two
zero-bits are appended to the resulting hash value, and then transformed to
Base64 notation as defined above. The resulting 43 characters make up the data
part of the trusty URI.

Empty files, for example, get the following URI suffix:

    FA47DEQpj8HBSa-_TImW-5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU

In general, when adding such a suffix to a URI, it has to be made sure that it
is preceded by a non-Base64 character, such as a dot (`.`), a slash (`/`), or a
hash sign (`#`).


### Module RA

Version A of module type R, i.e. module `RA`, works on RDF content, possibly
covering multiple named graphs.

This module allows for self-references, i.e. the trusty URI itself may appear
in the RDF data it represents. URIs consisting of the given trusty URI and a
suffix are also supported, such as:

    http://example.org/r2.RA5AbXdpz5DcaYXCh9l3eI9ruBosiL5XDU3rxBbBaUO70#Part1
    http://example.org/r2.RA5AbXdpz5DcaYXCh9l3eI9ruBosiL5XDU3rxBbBaUO70#Part2

Blank nodes are not supported and have to be skolemized when a trusty URI is
produced. For example, blank nodes can be transformed into URIs of the
following form:

    http://example.org/r2.RA5AbXdpz5DcaYXCh9l3eI9ruBosiL5XDU3rxBbBaUO70#_1
    http://example.org/r2.RA5AbXdpz5DcaYXCh9l3eI9ruBosiL5XDU3rxBbBaUO70#_2

It is assumed that the data is a set of named RDF graphs. RDF triples without a
named graph are considered to belong to a special named graph represented with
the empty string.

To check whether a given artifact code _c_ correctly represents a given set of
named graphs, first the triples and graphs have to be sorted. Because the
trusty URI can appear in the RDF data it represents, all occurrences of _c_ in
the URIs have to be replaced by a blank character in a preprocessing step. To
determine the order of any two triples, the first applicable rule of the
following list is applied:

1. If their graph URIs differ, the triple with the lexicographically smaller
   preprocessed graph URI is first.
2. If their subject URIs differ, the triple with the lexicographically smaller
   preprocessed subject URI is first.
3. If their predicate URIs differ, the triple with the lexicographically
   smaller preprocessed predicate URI is first.
4. If one has a literal as object and the other has a non-literal, the triple
   with the non-literal as object is first.
5. If both have a URI as object, the triple with the lexicographically smaller
   preprocessed object URI is first.
6. If the literal labels of the objects differ, the triple with the
   lexicographically smaller literal label is first.
7. If one of the object literals has a datatype identifier and the other does
   not, the triple without a datatype identifier is first.
8. If one of the object literals has a language identifier and the other does
   not, the triple without a language identifier is first.
9. The triple with the lexicographically smaller datatype or language
   identifier is first.

The lexicographic order is defined on strings of Unicode characters. If two
strings have different characters at at least one position, the string with the
smaller integer value at the first differing position is first. Otherwise, the
shorter string is first.

After the triples have been sorted, a sequence of Unicode characters _s_ is
built. For each triple, the serialization of its graph, its subject, its
predicate, and its object are added to the end of _s_, in this order and with a
newline character at the end of each of the four. The serialization of graph,
subject, and predicate identifiers is simply their preprocessed URI string.
Objects that consist of a URI are treated the same way. Literals with a
datatype are serialized as a circumflex character (`^`) followed by the
datatype URI, a blank space, and the escaped literal string. Literal strings
are escaped by replacing `\` by `\\` and newline characters by `\n`. Literals
with a language property are serialized as an at-sign `@` followed by the
language string, a blank space, and the escaped literal string. Other literals
are serialized as a hash sign `#` followed by the escaped literal string.

The actual computation of the hash data is identical to Module F: a SHA-256
hash is generated for _s_ in UTF-8 encoding, two zero-bits are appended, and
the result is transformed to Base64 notation.
